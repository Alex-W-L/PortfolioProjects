# Portland Crime Analysis – PPB Data Project

This repository contains my data analysis project exploring crime trends reported by the Portland Police Bureau. The project focuses on patterns in offenses across Portland ZIP codes both over time and by location (zip code), including a case study evaluating public claims regarding business closures due to increased theft.

## Project Overview

Using publicly available data from the Portland Police Bureau (PPB), this analysis explores:

- Crime trends over time and by ZIP code
- Distribution of various offense categories and types
- A focused analysis of Larceny-related offenses in zip codes with large retail closures
- Statistically-supported trend analysis using linear regression

Data was cleaned and prepared in Python, analyzed in SQL and Tableau, and visualized through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

## Tools & Skills

This project demonstrates my learning and growing proficiency with tools commonly used in data analytics:

- **Python**: Data cleaning, data merging, and preprocessing 
- **SQL (MySQL)**: Data exploration & aggregation
- **Tableau Public**: Interactive dashboards, visual trend analysis, and zip code mapping

## Career Goals

This project is part of my personal learning portfolio as I transition into a career in data analytics. I have a strong background in IT, electronics, and technical instruction, and I'm currently focused on developing analytical and visualization skills to support data-driven decision making.

## Tableau Dashboard

## Additions

Some other smaller learning projects are included here as well and can be seen in the Tableau Dashboard link. The projects involving covid and airbnb housing were guided using online resources. The PPB Project is entirely my own and originated out of a desire to both learn more about the process and a curiostiy surrounding larceny trends on how public data compares with large business closures due to theft.
